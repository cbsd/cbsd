/*
 * Functions list below is modelled after the Redis Command Reference (except
 * for the credis_connect() and credis_close() functions), use this reference
 * for further descriptions of each command:
 *
 *    http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/CommandReference
 *
 * Comments are only available when it is not obvious how Credis implements
 * the Redis command. In general, functions return 0 on success or a negative
 * value on error. Refer to CREDIS_ERR_* codes. The return code -1 is
 * typically used when for instance a key is not found.
 *
 * IMPORTANT! Memory buffers are allocated, used and managed by credis
 * internally. Subsequent calls to credis functions _will_ destroy the data
 * to which returned values reference to. If for instance the returned value
 * by a call to credis_get() is to be used later in the program, a strdup()
 * is highly recommended. However, each `REDIS' handle has its own state and
 * manages its own memory buffers independently. That means that one of two
 * handles can be destroyed while the other keeps its connection and data.
 *
 * EXAMPLE
 *
 * Connect to a Redis server and set value of key `fruit' to `banana':
 *
 *    REDIS rh = credis_connect("localhost", 6789, 2000);
 *    credis_set(rh, "fruit", "banana");
 *    credis_close(rh);
 *
 * TODO
 *
 *  - Add support for missing Redis commands marked as TODO below
 *  - Currently only support for zero-terminated strings, not for storing
 *    abritary binary data as bulk data. Basically an API issue since it is
 *    partially supported internally.
 *  - Test
